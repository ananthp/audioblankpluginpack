Radians (JS plugins, gfx_blit's rotation is in radians)

One radian is the angle of an arc created by wrapping the radius of a circle around its circumference.

The radius 'r' fits around the circumference of a circle exactly 2p times. That is why the circumference of a circle is given by:

            circumference = 2pr

So there are 2p radians in a complete circle, and p radians in a half circle.

Dialer knob divided as 12 units. Code for rotating knob image
gfx_blit(0,.6,n*2*$pi/12); // n= unit dialed. 0-11

Marshall amp's knobs have 12 units. Units 11 & 12 (n=10, 11) are not dialable.
